We start by having each team report back on their solution of the homework.

Then we have a lecture on Chapter 2 of the "React Projects" book and we look at
styled HTML components -- where the CSS is included in the javascript file along with the HTML
stateful components -- where the component has a state which changes, and is rerendered each time it changes
Then we have an exercise where we remove all CSS from the Classes Demo Homework and replaced it by styled components.

Finally, we work on modifying the Classes Demo Homework to be the Minimal Viable Product for our final projects.
